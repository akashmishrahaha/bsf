### Steps to Contribute Code

Follow the following steps to ensure your contribution goes smoothly.

1. Read and follow the steps outlined in the [BuildSafe Contributing Policy](README.md#contributing).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-forks/) the GitHub Repository allowing you to make the changes in your own copy of the repository.
3. Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/buildsafedev/bsf/issues) if one doesn't exist already.
4. Make the changes you would like to include, adding new tests where possible, and make sure all relevant existing tests are passing.
5. Ensure that you are in the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file (see the [Adding Yourself to the Contributors List](#adding-yourself-to-the-contributors-list) section for instructions)
6. Create a pull request on GitHub. If you're new to GitHub, read about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). You are welcome to submit your pull request for commentary or review before it is complete by creating a [draft pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests). Please include specific questions or items you'd like feedback on.
7. A member of the BuildSafe team will review your PR and either merge, comment, and/or assign someone for review.
8. Work with the reviewer to complete a code review. For each change, create a new commit and push it to make changes to your pull request. When necessary, the reviewer can trigger CI to run tests prior to merging.
9. Once you believe your pull request is ready to be reviewed, ensure the pull request is no longer a draft by [marking it ready for review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request).
10. The reviewer will look over your contribution and either approve it or provide comments letting you know if there is anything left to do. We try to give you the opportunity to make the required changes yourself, but in some cases, we may perform the changes ourselves if it makes sense to (minor changes or for urgent issues). We do our best to review PRs promptly, but complex changes could require more time.
11. After completing your review, a BuildSafe team member will trigger merge to run all tests. Upon passing, your change will be merged into `main`, and your pull requests will be closed. All merges to `main` create a new release, and all final changes are attributed to you.

Note: In some cases, we might decide that a PR should be closed without merging. We'll make sure to provide clear reasoning when this happens.

### Adding Yourself to the Contributors List

When making a pull request to the BuildSafe software, you must add yourself to the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS.md) list.
You will only have to do this the first time that you contribute to the software.
For this, we recommend adding yourself with a separate commit (does not have to be a separate PR) to the file.
